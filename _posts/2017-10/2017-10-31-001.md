Diving head first into innovative design, the quirky GOGGLES Yellow Bubble Umbrella has its sights set to fun. Featuring an ingenious goggle shaped cut-out, a piece of the of the umbrella’s canopy has been replaced with clear plastic. By doing this, the canopy cut-out allows you to see the street ahead without lifting the umbrella out of the way. Continuing with the clever water theme, the top of the umbrella’s canopy features a periscope shaped cap. Made from anti-slip rubber, this cap allows the umbrella to lean against a wall without falling. Taking rain showers on by storm, the deep birdcage frame, soft hook handle and matte yellow color provide the perfect balance of high-quality and high-design. Great as a gift or for buy one for yourself; owning one of these Goggle Umbrellas will take your wet-weather style to new depths.
