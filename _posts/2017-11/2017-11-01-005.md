I spend a lot of time on my computer typing and I was dying to have a keyboard that fun and interesting. I couldn't find anything I liked so I built my own. With the help of Kickstarter I was able to bring this keyboard to life and make it available for everyone. We are a tiny company making what we love with the highest concern for quality and customer care. With your support, we hope to bring more products like Qwerkywriter to life to share with everyone! Thanks so much
