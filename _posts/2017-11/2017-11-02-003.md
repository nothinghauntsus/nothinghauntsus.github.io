Orange and white. One of a kind. Control your BB-8 App-Enabled Droid with your smart device and keep BB-8 sharp with the augmented reality Droid Trainer. Watch BB-8 interact with other Star Wars App-enabled Droids by Sphero, and view films from the Star Wars saga with BB-8 by your side. BB-8 is more than a toy – it’s a companion.


• Autonomous behavior - send BB-8 out to Patrol on its own, or even watch him move while charging.<br>
• Holographic simulation - explore the star Wars galaxy with the app and the Droid trainer.<br>
• Droid-to-Droid Experience - Watch BB-8 interact with other Star Wars App-enabled Droids by Sphero.<br>
• Watch With Me - View films from the Star Wars saga with BB-8 by your side.<br>
• Authentic movement - the Tech within BB-8 allows it to roll and move his dome just like on-screen.<br>
