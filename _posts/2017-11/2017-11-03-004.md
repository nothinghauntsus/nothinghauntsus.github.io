Scape Filters are neutral density (ND) filters that reduce the intensity of light coming to a camera lens along with reducing shutter speed when capturing footage. 

Sunnier and brighter days require higher amount of light reduction to give you a cinematic look for your videos. Our recommended filter for such conditions is the ND8 or ND16 Filter. Darker and cloudier days need lower range ND filters. Our recommended filter for such conditions is the ND4 filter.
